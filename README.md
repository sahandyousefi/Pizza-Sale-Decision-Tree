# Pizza-Sale-Decision-Tree
This project predicts pizza sales using a Decision Tree Regressor. It includes cross-validation for robustness and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize performance, achieving low prediction errors. The pipeline showcases effective modeling for business insights.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict pizza sales using a Decision Tree model based on various influencing factors. The dataset includes historical sales data with relevant features such as date, weather conditions, promotions, pizza type, and store location. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model to help businesses forecast sales and optimize inventory management.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset

Date: The day of sales.
Store ID: Unique identifier for each store.
Pizza Type: Type of pizza sold (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, BBQ Chicken).
Price: Selling price of each pizza.
